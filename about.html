<p>Since 1955, we 	&#39;ve been proud to serve the world some of its favorite food. And along the way, we 	&#39;ve managed not just to live history, but create it:  from drive-thru restaurants to Chicken McNuggets to college credits from Hamburger U and much more. It 	&#39;s been quite the journey, and we promise this is just the beginning-we 	&#39;ve got our hearts set on making more history.</p>
<img class="img" src="images/Ronald.jpg" alt="Ronald" align="right" width="150px" height="240px"/><p>The business began in 1940, with a restaurant opened by brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald at 1398 North E Street at West 14th Street in San Bernardino, California. Their introduction of the "Speedee Service System" in 1948 furthered the principles of the modern fast-food restaurant that the White Castle hamburger chain had already put into practice more than two decades earlier. The original mascot of McDonald's was a man with a chef's hat on top of a hamburger shaped head whose name was "Speedee". Speedee was eventually replaced with Ronald McDonald by 1967 when the company first filed a U.S. trademark on a clown shaped man having puffed out costume legs.</p></div>
